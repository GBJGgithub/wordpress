"To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"<li>Check if the stream has metadata: If the metadata is not present, then it won’t be possible to display the current song title on the player.</li>\n"
"<li>Make sure the “Show Track Title” setting is enabled in the player controls settings.</li>\n"
"<li>Make sure <b>allow_url_fopen</b> is enabled on the server: If allow_url_fopen is disabled on the server, the player won’t be able to retrieve the metadata from the stream. You can contact your web host to enable this setting or modify the server configuration yourself if you have access.</li>\n"
"<li>If the stream title still not showing then try to enable the <strong>Metadata Proxy</strong> settings from the HTTP player settings tab in the plugin settings page.</li>\n"
"<li>If you’ve tried these steps and still can’t display the current song title on your player, please don’t hesitate to contact us for further assistance.</li>\n"
